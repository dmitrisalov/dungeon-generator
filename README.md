### About Dungeons
In video games, dungeons are are indoor areas that consist of collections of rooms and hallways. They may feature furniture, enemy 
creatures, chests, and shops. They usually provide some sort of reward for players to explore them and may have a story element taking 
place in them. Usually, these areas are hand-made to be unique in a gameworld. However, in large game worlds that feature a multitude of 
unique dungeons, it may be beneficial to procedurally generate them to allow for developers to spend more time on other parts of the game.
In certain video game genres, the randomized dungeons are an element crucial to the game experience.
